This is the simulation for Dijkstra's algorithm.
[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://jithinks97.github.io/Dynamic-Learning/Dijkstras/index.html)

Enter the source and the destination node number, i.e 0 - 11, the simulation will show the shortest path between the source node and the destination node.

Each red dot represents the node and the lines represents the path between the nodes.

Drag the node and the shortest path is changed dynamically.

To delete a node, select it and press delete button.
